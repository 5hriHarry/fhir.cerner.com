  cardinality: 0..1
  type: CodeableConcept
  description: >
    The assessment made based on the result of the observation. Intended as a simple compact code often placed adjacent
    to the result value in reports and flow sheets to signal the meaning/normalcy status of the result. Otherwise known
    as abnormal flag.

- name: component
  required: 'No'
  cardinality: 0..*
  type: BackboneElement
  description: >
    Some observations have multiple component observations. These component observations are expressed as separate code
    value pairs that share the same attributes. Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for
    blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations.
